New issues with bug reports or new feature proposals are welcome of course - but nothing speaks like proposed code and pull requests.. thus that's the preferred way of contributing to this project!  To propose a change, do the usual GitHub thing:

Pull this, create a local branch.

Then first, add your name to CONTRIBUTORS.md as part of your PR! ;-)

Then, hack some cool extension, bug fix, etc.

Raise Pull Request...

Thanks for your help!
