SOME DAY

- uid & pwd on DBConfigurationBuilder etc.

- How to do 32 vs 64 bit?! How to detect? How to choose? (Is it even needed? Prio?)

- my.cnf files support?

- mysqlcheck --auto-repair --all-databases -u root

- LICENSE.txt & README must be included in JAR


LATER, MAY BE (or not)

- could use http://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/wiki/ServiceExplained

- could split project into multi-module, e.g. exec4j, mariaDB4j-core, mariaDB4j-db-win, mariaDB4j-db-linux (and still have a mariaDB4j:mariaDB4j which aggregates them all like initial version)

- propose ch.vorburger.exec as "handy utilities" to commons-exec?

- DBConfiguration & Co. with File instead String baseDir, dataDir & socket
