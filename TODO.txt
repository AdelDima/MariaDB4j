SOME DAY

- must close Ext. Proc. STDIN / STDOUT & STDERR, on destroy as well as if running in daemon mode?

- uid & pwd on DBConfigurationBuilder etc.

- LICENSE.txt & README must be included in all *-db JARs

- Sync Bintray deploy to Maven Central
  http://blog.bintray.com/2014/02/11/bintray-as-pain-free-gateway-to-maven-central/ or 
  https://github.com/jirutka/maven-badges, or https://github.com/jirutka/maven-badges

- make ch.vorburger.exec a separate GitHub project, sobmodule it in, and blog about / publicize it..

LATER, MAY BE (or not)

- propose ch.vorburger.exec as "handy utilities" to commons-exec?
  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/EXEC-88 
   
- my.cnf files support?

- mysqlcheck --auto-repair --all-databases -u root

- could use http://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/wiki/ServiceExplained

- DBConfiguration & Co. with File instead String baseDir, dataDir & socket

- How to do 32 vs 64 bit?! How to detect? How to choose? (Is it even needed? Prio?)
