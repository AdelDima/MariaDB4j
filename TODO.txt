BEFORE RELEASING v1

- Automatic Port assignment (useful in general and crucial for newEmbeddedTemporaryDB)

- TODOs

- How to do 32 vs 64 bit?! How to detect? How to choose? (Is it even needed? Prio?)

- my.cnf files support?

- mysqlcheck --auto-repair --all-databases -u root

- contact ABC & XYZ if any thoughts or advise?

- Apache License header everywhere

- LICENSE.txt & README must be included in JAR

- pom.xml must have all required elements so that this doesn't complain: 
  mvn clean verify source:jar javadoc:jar repository:bundle-create


LATER, MAY BE

- could split project into multi-module, e.g. exec4j, mariaDB4j-core, mariaDB4j-db-win, mariaDB4j-db-linux (and still have a mariaDB4j:mariaDB4j which aggregates them all like initial version)

- propose ch.vorburger.exec as "handy utilities" to commons-exec?
