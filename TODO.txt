SOME DAY

- ze #1 bug

- uid & pwd on DBConfigurationBuilder etc.

- could split project into multi-module, e.g. mariaDB4j-core, mariaDB4j-app (shaded), mariaDB4j-db-win32, mariaDB4j-db-linux64, mariaDB4j-db-mac64 (and still have a mariaDB4j:mariaDB4j which aggregates them all like initial version)

- LICENSE.txt & README must be included in JAR


LATER, MAY BE (or not)

- propose ch.vorburger.exec as "handy utilities" to commons-exec?

- my.cnf files support?

- mysqlcheck --auto-repair --all-databases -u root

- could use http://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/wiki/ServiceExplained

- DBConfiguration & Co. with File instead String baseDir, dataDir & socket

- How to do 32 vs 64 bit?! How to detect? How to choose? (Is it even needed? Prio?)
