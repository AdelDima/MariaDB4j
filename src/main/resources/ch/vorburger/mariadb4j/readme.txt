This folders contains, per platform (ch.vorburger.mariadb4j.Platform),
the bin/mysql_install_db, mysqld, mysqlcheck & share/*
(currently about 13.5 MB on Win, 35 MB on Linux).

These files come from a standard MariaDB distribution
(or technically if you must Oracle mySQL really would as well - as exactly the same commands).
